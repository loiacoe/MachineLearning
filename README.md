# üß† Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks showcasing machine learning projects using popular public datasets. Each project explores different algorithms and techniques using libraries such as **Scikit-learn**, **Keras**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

All notebooks are compatible with **Google Colab**, and the datasets used are publicly available through `sklearn.datasets` or other common sources, requiring no special setup.

## üîç Contents

- **IRIS Dataset**  
  A classic classification problem using the iris flower dataset. Includes data visualization, preprocessing, and model training using decision trees and logistic regression.

- **Linear Regression 2D**  
  A basic example of linear regression on two-dimensional data. Great for understanding gradient descent and loss minimization.

- **MNIST Dataset**  
  Digit classification using a neural network built with Keras. Demonstrates image preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation.

- **Titanic Dataset**  
  A binary classification problem predicting survival from the Titanic dataset. Includes feature engineering and model comparison.

- **Penguin Dataset**  
  Exploratory data analysis and classification on the Palmer Penguins dataset, a modern alternative to Iris.

- **Wine Dataset**  
  Multiclass classification problem using chemical analysis of wines. Shows use of PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

- **Reuters Dataset**  
  Text classification using a neural network on the Reuters newswire dataset. Includes tokenization, embedding, and model evaluation.

- **Reviewer Dataset**  
  Sentiment analysis or classification on reviewer data (depending on implementation). Highlights natural language preprocessing and model design.
